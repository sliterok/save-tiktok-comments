## A Note on Permissions and Privacy

This extension uses the `chrome.debugger` permission to capture comments. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Why is it needed?** The `debugger` permission allows the extension to intercept the network traffic between your browser and TikTok's servers. This is the most reliable way to capture the comment data as you scroll, without resorting to less reliable methods like screen scraping.

- **Is it secure?** The extension is designed to *only* listen to the specific API requests that load comments on TikTok. It does not access your personal data, passwords, or browsing history on other websites. The source code is available for you to review.

- **Browser Warning**: When the extension is active on a TikTok tab, Chrome will display a warning bar at the top of the window (e.g., "TikTok Comment Exporter is debugging this browser"). This is a standard security feature from Chrome to let you know that an extension is interacting with the page. The warning will disappear when you close the TikTok tab.
